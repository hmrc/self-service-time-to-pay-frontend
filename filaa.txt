How we calculate interest
We only charge interest on overdue amounts.
We charge the Bank of England base rate plus 2.5%, calculated as simple interest.
If the interest rate changes during your plan, your monthly payments will not change. If we need to, we'll settle the difference at the end of the plan.
I cannot afford the minimum payment
You may still be able to set up a payment plan over the phone, but you are not eligible for an online payment plan.
We recommend you speak to an adviser on 0300 200 3835 at the Business Support Service to talk about your payment options.
