    //We want to replace SessionTimeoutFilter with SessionTimeoutFilterWrapper
    //which omits application of this filter for 'TestUsersController.logIn()' functionality.
    val t = defaultFrontendFilters.map {
      case s: SessionTimeoutFilter => new SessionTimeoutFilterWrapper(s)
      case x                       => x
    }
